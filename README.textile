h1. WordPress Boilerplate

This is a simple and robust starting point for developing WordPress themes. This theme contains no styling, and includes a minified jQuery 1.8.3

I recommend using a "styleguide":http://larrybotha.github.com/styleguide/ for a plainly styled CSS boilerplate that includes WordPress defaults.

h2. Features

This theme has the following features:
# concise, uncluttered, and well commented templates
# a well featured functions.php
# "H5BP's":https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/.htaccess htaccess, with additional WordPress security

h2. Usage

# clone this repo into your WordPress install's themes/ folder
# develop your WordPress theme in debug mode
# party.
